# learning-srasterizer
This is a simple software rasterizer I implemented in C as a means to further my understanding of core rendering and rasterization concepts (and the C language as a whole) This is by no means a professional project nor did it aim to be one. The code is sort of messy but it works (for the most part)

## Features
- Triangle rasterization from scratch
- Line drawing
- Basic color handling with a framebuffer
- In house "math" library

## Notes
Some features are not yet implemented such as proper texturing and UV usage, and the shading is very simple for now just a direction with Lamber lighting. The codebase leaves much to be desired but it was deffinetly fun learning the fundamentals since I am a fan of doing things from scratch. This was my first bigger project so I can not expect the build system to be portable nor this repo to be seen by anyone so the build system is very bare bones.
